The test_dump.py, test_listen.py, and test_interrupt.py files are
meant to be called with two arguments. The first argument is the path
of a .sql file that contains queries to run. These .sql files should
operate on one database and should begin assuming the database has
already been created and selected (so no 'USE [db]' query is
necessary). A few .sql files that can used for testing are in the
sqlfiles directory. The second argument is the name of the database
being replicated.
